<h5>What can be done with this tool?</h5>
<p>
    The BMT allows to compare two BoK-annotated resources.

<h5>What is a BoK-annotated resource?</h5>
<p>
    All resources created with EO4GEO tools (i.e., occupational profiles, job offers, educational offers) are
    automatically annotated when created.
    <br />
    Any other file following the <a
        href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/eo4geo-uji.appspot.com/o/manuals%2FBoKAnnotationGuidelines-v1-1.pdf?alt=media&token=d3706c50-7a49-4b7c-a893-553dfe09f72d"
        target="_blank" rel=""> Annotation Guidelines (v1.1) </a> can also be understood by the BMT and can be used for
    comparison.

<h5>What examples of a comparison can be done?</h5>
<p>
    For example, a university could compare an academic study program with an occupational profile, to discover how
    much of
    the knowledge required for the occupational profile is covered by the study program - and possibly adjust the study
    program to remedy missing knowledge. Or, a graduate could compare a job offer with his graduate school program, to
    discover which knowledge heâ€™s missing, and determine a VET course to complement this knowledge. Or, one could
    annotate a
    pdf file according to the guidelines (for example, a scientific article) and compare it with another resource (for
    example, a course described in the CDT tool), to determine suitability of the article to serve as reading
    assignment.</p>
